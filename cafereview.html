      <p>This was my first cafe review. It is located at Pasar Seni, KL. The engagement was surprisingly impressive for a first try. I voiced out me and my friends' honest opinion with what we ordered at the time which was easy for me being a foodie that likes to eat as long as the food is good</p>

    <div class="description">
      <p>My secod time was around Selangor so I dont mind giving it a try while inviting my friends to come along. The cafe just opened up the place and needed people to review their cafe. They even gave me specific content of how they want the video to appear. This cafe even provided a free meal and a free souvenir to bring home. Sadly, the engagement did not satisfy them but I enjoyed the experience as well as a lesson to better my videos in the future.</p>

      <p>This cafe was a desserts cafe near Conlay MRT. Eventhough, it is located pretty far but I was willing to go and hang out with my friends as well. The place was small but full of luxury and warmth, perfect for evening tea time. The engagement was also not satisfied for me knowing How much I could achieve before but I enjoyed making the video and the experience of traveling there.</p>
