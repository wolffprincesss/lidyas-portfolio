    <div class="description">
      <p>Me and my team decided to focus on creating Instagram for this small business as the target audience demographic mostly uses this platform but Instagram engagement are pretty slow unless we boost our posts which as students, money do not come easy for us. Since we are beginners in digital marketing as well, our client did not pay that big of an amount.</p>

    <div class="description">
      <p>One social media is not enough to boost up the promotion and since Instagram has a lower rating for engagement, we decided to use the Tiktok app as well. The mistake we made while using this platform was not recognizing the algorithm and the factors of viraling the video. Thankfully, the business owner was satisfied with the outcome and sales have been increasing for them as well.</p>

    <div class="description">
      <p>For the assignment, we were required to find a client without the exposed of digital marketing and help their business grow. Therefore, we come up with a creative proposal for the business owner and readied a report for the our lecturer as well. In the report, we include the issues faced and insights of our website and postings. It was a wonderful experience and helped me with my skills.</p>
